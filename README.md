# SuperCollider Example Client

A basic example that demostrates OSCCore controlling SuperCollider over OSC protocol.
It will set frequency and amplitude parameters of a SuperCollider synth and make it play for two seconds.

## Usage

Have SuperCollider `example1.scd` file loaded and run first. Then build and run the example.

```swift
swift build
swift run
```

Have fun!
