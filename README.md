# SuperCollider Example Client

A basic example that demostrates [OSCCore](https://github.com/segabor/OSCCore) controlling [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) over [OSC protocol](http://opensoundcontrol.org).
It will set frequency and amplitude parameters of a SuperCollider synth and make it play for two seconds.

## Usage

Have SuperCollider `example1.scd` file loaded and run first. Then build and run the example.

```swift
swift build
swift run
```

Have fun!
